      <h1>Mediaspace Galleries</h1>
      <p>
        A Mediaspace Gallery is a space for a department to store their videos.
        Depending on the requested settings, this Gallery can either be
        restricted to specific users or opened to the general public. Upon
        creation, a Mediaspace Gallery will have an assigned owner (manager).
        This person will be responsible for configuring the Gallery’s viewing
        restrictions, adding and deleting Gallery members, enabling moderation
        and permitting comments for published videos.
      </p>
      <figure class="img"><img src="assets/3.png" alt /></figure>
      <p>
        To obtain a Mediaspace Gallery, a department must make a request to the
        ETS team specifying the type of Gallery they would like to have created
        for them. Additionally, they must also provide the A0 number of an
        individual they would like as their Gallery’s owner (manager).
        <strong
          >Prospective Gallery owners must attend a Mediaspace Gallery owner’s
          workshop hosted by an ETS member if it is their first time managing a
          Mediaspace Gallery.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are the types of Media Galleries a department may request (please
        note that Gallery managers can change this type after it has been
        created)
      </p>
      <h2>Creating and Configuring Galleries (ETS only)</h2>
      <p>
        Mediaspace Galleries are set on the
        <a href="https://api.ca.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng">Kaltura KMC</a>. To
        create a gallery ETS staff should log in, go to the
        <strong>Categories tab</strong> and then click the
        <strong>Add Category button.</strong> Give the category the name the
        client has requested and set the parent categories to
        <strong>‘Media &gt; site &gt; galleries’,</strong> then click
        <strong>Apply.</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="swapper">
        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/4.jpeg" alt /></figure>
        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/5.jpeg" alt /></figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        When the Gallery has been created go directly into the Entitlements
        module. What determines a Gallery’s type boils down to three settings.
      </p>
      <div class="key-point">
        <p>

          (videos) inside the Gallery

        <p>
          <strong>Category Listing</strong> – Determines who can see the Gallery
          on the frontpage of Mediaspace
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Content Publish Permissions</strong> – Determines whether
          members of the public can view videos inside the Gallery (Not

          restrictions’ )

      <h2>Gallery Roles</h2>
      <p>
        Mediaspace Galleries have several of roles that can be assigned to their
        members by Gallery managers. These roles differ from viewing only rights
        to full editing rights. These roles are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Member -</strong> Anyone with this role can view content
          inside a gallery (this role is not necessary to apply if your Gallery
          is not set to Private)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contributor</strong> – Anyone with this role will have the
          ability to view, create and publish content inside a Gallery
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moderator</strong> – Anyone with this role can view, create
          and publish content inside a Gallery. The Moderators can also approve
          or reject content from being published into the Gallery. (<strong
            >Note:</strong
          >
          Moderate Content in the Gallery Options must be enabled by the Gallery
          Manager before Moderators can approve/reject content)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manager</strong> – Anyone with this role has full
          administrator rights into the Gallery. Managers can view, create and
          publish content into the Gallery. Managers can also enable moderation,
          enable comments, moderate content, change the Gallery type, add or
          remove Gallery metadata and assign or remove members and their roles.
          Gallery managers can also delete the Gallery in its entirety (this
          action is irreversible, deleted galleries cannot be recovered by ETS
          or Kaltura)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manger (Owner)</strong> – The same as the manger role except
          this role cannot be deleted by other Gallery managers. One person will
          be assigned this role upon the Gallery’s creation by the ETS team
        </li>
      </ul>
