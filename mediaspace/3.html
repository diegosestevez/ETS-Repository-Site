      <h1>Mediaspace Channels</h1>
      <p>
        Mediaspace Channels are another type of video storage repository that
        Kaltura Mediaspace offers. Like Galleries, Channels exist as a space
        where content can be published and managed by an individual (or
        individuals) with a manager role. Unlike galleries, Channels are spaces
        which can be published. Hierarchically speaking, you think of Channels
        as child repositories of Galleries (Channels that remain unpublished are
        the exception).
      </p>
      <p>
        Channel managers can only publish their Channels into Galleries if they
        have at least a ‘contributor’ role in that Gallery. If a Channel resides
        within a Gallery then only managers of the Channel can unpublish the
        Channel from that Gallery. However individuals who own at least one
        Gallery in Mediaspace will have the ability to create Channels. This
        ensures that these individuals are the owners of every Channel that they
        create for their own Galleries.
      </p>
      <figure class="img"><img src="assets/8.png" alt /></figure>
      <p>
        Just like Galleries, Channels come in different types.
        <strong
          >In order to view any kind of Channels in Mediaspace, authentication
          past BCIT’s SSO is required.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Channels</h2>
      <div class="definition">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Private channel</strong> – Channel and its contents are
            viewable by anyone with a BCIT A00 account
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Restricted channel</strong> – Only members of this channel
            may see this channel, it’s contents and contribute content
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h2>Creating Channels</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Mediaspace Gallery owners are the only ones that can create
          Channels.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a channel click on the <strong>‘All Channels’ tab</strong> in
        the navigation bar and then click on the
        <strong>‘+ Create Channel’</strong> button<strong>.</strong> Give your
        channel its title, name, description and tags by which to search for and
        then set your channel privacy level (type). You can then publish the
        channel to any Mediasapce Galleries you manage (or that is set to
        public).
      </p>
