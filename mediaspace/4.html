      <h1>Mediaspace Content Options</h1>
      <p>
        Just like the video options inside the Learning Hub, videos that are
        uploaded into Mediaspace have options which can be configured by a
        video’s owner/co-owner. Most of these options are quite similar to the
        ones found for videos in the Learning Hub, however there are some
        features exclusive to Mediaspace. Mediaspace content has the following
        options:
      </p>
      <div class="definition">

        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/32.png" alt /></figure>
      </div>
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>
        Will show you a video’s title, tags and the names of any or all Channels
        or Galleries it is associated to.
      </p>
      <figure class="img"><img src="assets/33.png" alt /></figure>
      <h2>Share</h2>
      <p>
        Will allow a video’s owner to share their videos via either a shared
        link, embed code or an email message containing the shared link.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <h3>Link to Media Page</h3>
        <p>Produces a URL which the video owner can send to others</p>
        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/34.png" alt /></figure>
        <h3>Embed</h3>
        <p>
          Produces html code that the video owner can use to embed the video
          into other websites, web applications or web services.
        </p>
        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/35.png" alt /></figure>
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>
          Opens up the owners preferred email and produces a URL in the body of
          the email which can be sent to others (Note: this feature will not
          work if the video has not been published into either a Channel or
          Gallery).
        </p>
        <figure class="img"><img src="assets/36.png" alt /></figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Link/Embed code security</h3>
      <p>
        Please note that security of a link for each option above is dependent
        entirely on where the video is published. For example if a video is
        published into a Gallery that is set to ‘Open’, then anyone will be able
        to access the video via generated link. In contrast if it is published
        in into a space that is ‘Private’, then only members of that Channel or
        Gallery may access it. For a quick reference of link/embed code security
        please consult the chart below:
