      <h1>Entries</h1>
      <p>
        The Entries sub-tool displays every single video that has been created
        at BCIT in the Learning Hub (and later Mediaspace). Inside Entries, you
        have the ability to alter metadata, captions &amp; ownership rights of
        individual videos or groups of videos. You also have the ability to
        insert or remove videos from course Media Galleries in Brightspace as
        well. To do this go into
        <strong>view details &gt; metadata,</strong> then click
        <strong>Browse Categories and</strong> under
        <strong>D2L &gt; Site &gt; Channel</strong> and select the Media
        Gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more detailed information concerning the Entries tab please see the

      <h2>View Details</h2>
      <p>

        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>
          The fields you see inside Metadata contribute to a video’s
          searchability inside both the KMC and in My Media/Media Gallery. The
          fields seen in here are same ones populated by the instructor in the
          Learning Hub when they first publish the video into their course on
          the Learning Hub.
        </p>
        <h3>Thumbnails</h3>
        <p>
          You can choose to upload or a replace a thumbnail for a video in this
          area.
        </p>
        <h3>Access Control</h3>
        <p>
          If the video is published outside of the Learning Hub (or BCIT
          MediaSpace) then this tool can be used to restrict which domains
          (websites) the video is allowed to appear in. These restrictions are
          created and managed using the
          <a href="https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/managing-access-profiles"
            ><strong>Access Control Profile</strong></a
          ><strong>.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
          Can be used to restrict the window of time a video is viewable by. You
          can think of this a little like the start and end times for students
          that you see on the Learning Hub’s quiz tool, except for Kaltura
          videos
        </p>
        <h3>Flavors</h3>
        <p>
          Will let you restrict how Kaltura coverts a video file when it is
          first uploaded. (We will likely not need to touch this tool)
        </p>
        <h3>Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Is used for publishing videos on platforms like YouTube with all of
          Kaltura’s metadata &amp; flavors prepopulated. (We have no such
          integration and will not need to touch this tool)
        </p>
        <h3>Captions</h3>
        <p>
          This feature will let you upload, remove or replace caption files for
          videos. In order for captions to display properly, the video player
          playing videos must be properly configured in the
          <a
            href="https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/universal-studio-information-guide"
            ><strong>STUDIO</strong></a
          >
          tab. The Learning Hub’s Video should however be properly configured at
          this point.
        </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Co-Publishers</strong> - can publish media to their entitled

            for the Media Collaboration features. When enabled, you can select
            groups that may be assigned as co-editors/publishers for an entry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Co-Viewers</strong> - are only able to view media and do not
            have editing permissions, nor are they allowed to view unlisted
            entries, unless they are also co-publishers or co-editors of that
            entry.
