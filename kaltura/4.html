      <h1>Introduction to Media Gallery</h1>
      <p>
        The course Media Gallery is where all videos that have been published to
        that specific course live. Unlike My Media, videos that are in Media
        Gallery are viewable by anyone who has access into that course.

      <h2>Editing your Media Gallery</h2>
      <p>
        Using the <strong>Edit</strong> option you can give your Media Gallery a
        description or toggle its options. Media Gallery has four options that
        you can choose to turn off or on, they are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Moderate content (media will not appear in media gallery until
          approved by the gallery manager)
        </li>
        <li>Enable comments in Media Gallery</li>
        <li>Keep comments private to Media Gallery.</li>
        <li>Display embedded media in this Media Gallery</li>
      </ol>
      <figure class="img"><img src="assets/19.jpeg" alt /></figure>
      <h3>Approving student videos</h3>
      <p>
        If you have enabled the <strong>Moderate content</strong> option then
        anybody who does not have instructor access into the course will have to
        have their video approved by an instructor in order to have their videos
        show up in the course Media Gallery. You will notice that a
        <strong>“Pending”</strong> tab will appear whenever someone who is not
        an instructor attempts to publish a video into the Media Gallery. It is
        in this tab that you can approve or reject videos.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        This option can be used to view general statistics concerning the course
        Media Gallery. Things like the most frequently view video, average
        duration views &amp; etc. can be viewed here.
      </p>
      <h2>Importing a Media Gallery from another course</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Import</strong> option will allow you to import all videos
        saved in another Media Gallery from a different course. Select the
        course whose Media Gallery you wish to import and all the videos from
        there will be copied over into the Media Gallery you are currently in.
      </p>

          another course. Importing individual videos from another media gallery
          is not possible
